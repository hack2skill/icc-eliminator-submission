# Introduction
GeoCricket AR ™ is an app that allows capturing and storing photos in the geo-space and time. Using the smartphone and, with the help of augmented reality and geospatial technology, the app will capture photos of your visit to a cricket sports event and overlay them onto the real-world map, creating a virtual time capsule of your cricket experience. Other visitors to the same cricket stadium (or even yourself at a later time) will walk around and view photos at the place and angle they were captured. This results in stadiums all over the world that are geotagged with past and current photographic memories of the cricket fans.


**Metadata:** the app will also provide context to your photos, such as the date and time they were taken, providing users with a sense of historical context of the location.


**Social Engagement**: the app will also feature a social component, allowing users, not only see photos from matches and events they attended, but also to leave comments, likes and reactions to photos, creating a social and interactive experience for everyone. This way the app will not only preserve anyone’s memories but also create a community of cricket enthusiasts who share a love for the sport.


**Web Platform**: optionally, from the comfort of your couch, you’ll be able to explore the collection of any cricket stadium in the world, revisit favorite moments, award popularity points (“likes”) to the best photos and share your own photos collections with friends and family.


**Selfies with your favorite players**: on your way to your seat, the app will superimpose 4D life-sized, volumetric models of your favorite cricket players among the crowd. When you walk close to them, they will talk to you and you could then take a virtual selfie with the player and share it on social media.


**Popularity Routes**: the app will track the number of views, likes, comments, and shares each photo receives and assign it a popularity score based on this data. The next time you arrive at the stadium with your ticket at hand, you will scan the barcode in your ticket and the app will suggest routes to your seat based on the sum of the popularity scores of the pictures taken on the way - providing an enjoyable and fun way to spend spare time before the great event.
