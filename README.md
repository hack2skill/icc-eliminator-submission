The platform is designed to cater to the needs of cricket fans who want to engage with the game in a more interactive and engaging way. With the Metaplex, users can access a stadium where they can enjoy live matches, get live updates on scores, player information, stats like runs per over through graphs, and other relevant information in real-time. The platform also provides users with a chatbot integration feature that allows them to engage with ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI, to get personalized responses to their queries and comments.
