## Brief Description and Snapshots -
### Description
- The Idea is to create a platform that can be used to provide mintable Extended Reality Digital Assets to the fans who engage in the practice of buying merch and match tickets. 
- The Digital Assets are activated through the help of AR and VR to provide different experience to the fans as well as add on points to the fans profile.
- These experiences and points are configurable for the different types of merch/tickets and the rarity of the Digital Asset.
- These Digital Assets are used to unlock the experiences in XR. These experiences range from special unlockable filters and videos to a display in a Virtual showroom in the Metaverse.
- The points accrued over time by the fan can be used by ICC to provide rewards like signed memorabilia or a meet & greet with their favourite cricketer.

### Features
- XR Experiences
- Gamified for maximum Engagement
