## Problem Statement:
According to the given problem statement of fintech to incentivize the interaction and transaction with the ICC Content for a better fan experience, basically designing a loyalty experience for fans with fintech at the centre of it.
Providing the best experience of the ICC content such as ICC TV, Crictos, ICC Events and Awards and everything being covered by modern monetary exchange system provided by NIUM (following card payments, UPIs, Net banking) between ICC and its fan base.

## How different is it from any other existing ideas out there?
Existing ideas focus on the traditional as well as some extent of monetary exchanges but it lacks accepting payments via cryptocurrencies which is the most emerging way of transaction between two bodies. Existing ideas have an integration of basic payment methods like UPI, Net Banking and Card. We are providing a Proof of Concept that covers all the already existing methods and adds up a way to add cryptocurrency exchange process and adding NIUM as a parent node for the tracking of all the payment process carried out at all levels and covers all the ICC and Cricket fans. 

Existing payment methods works properly with the legacy systems but using a single platform to track all the transactions at a single place for better planning of the system and easy feature implementation in future.

## How will it be able to solve the problem?
Based on the requirements given in the problem statement, our approach is based on NIUM and the basic payment concepts based in specific regions. We are providing an abstraction for the ICC and it’s multiple boards to accept payments through their fans in an organized way for all their ICC contents available to the fans. We are also enhancing the fan experience in multiple ways by providing a 3D interface to book tickets in stadiums, a cricket game <a href = "https://mahesh-2029.itch.io/cricket-2d">(Game Prototype Link) </a> to avail benefits and our model helps to incentivize fans to interact with it get multiple offers and benefits which is also in favour of ICC.
