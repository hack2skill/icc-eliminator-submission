Implementation of the Idea: 
1. User profiles: The first step would be to create user profiles that are linked to specific accounts in the website. These profiles could include
basic information about the user, such as their name, location, and interests, as well as their activity history within the community.
2. Toxic behavior identification: Using machine learning and natural language processing techniques, the online community could identify
patterns of toxic behavior,such as hate speech, harassment, or trolling. These patterns could be used to flag specific users or messages
that are deemed problematic.
3. Profile tracking: Once a user has been flagged for toxic behavior, their profile could be tracked more closely. This could include monitoring
their activity history within the community, tracking the language and tone of their messages, and analyzing their interactions with other
users.
4. Consequences: If a user is found to be engaging in toxic behavior, there could be consequences for their account. For example, they could
receive a warning or be temporarily or permanently banned from the community. Additionally, their behavior could be flagged in their
profile, which could make it more difficult for them to participate in other online communities.
5. Ticket tracking: The website could allow users to create a profile and link it to their ticket purchases. This would enable the website to track
the user's attendance history, preferred seating locations, and other relevant data.
6. Personalized recommendations: Based on the user's attendance history and preferences, the website could offer personalized
recommendations for future games. For example, if a user frequently attends games with friends, the website could suggest group seating
options.
7. Feedback and suggestions: The website could allow users to provide feedback and suggestions on their stadium experience, such as
rating the quality of seating, food, and other amenities. This feedback could be used by stadium management to improve the overall
experience.
8. Social features: The website could also have social features, such as the ability to connect with other fans and share photos and updates
from the game. This would create a sense of community and enhance the overall fan experience

"To host the site you can fork the repo and go to pages section in the settings and then deploy it in the by the selected branch /root and donot give custom url because mostly you might face dns server error and then when the link is generated to the site you can checkout our site."


Here is a live demo of the website and explaining all the content present in the website.
