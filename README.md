Fans would have the option to choose between different packages, such as a package that includes only candid photos, a package that includes only key moment photos, or a combination package that includes both.

- In order to include this feature a combination of unmanned drones and Fixed cameras in the stadium which points to the location of the audience automatically who booked it and will take the pics based on their preferences (Candid or Pose). These pics will be delivered to them through the app when they leave the stadium to give a great ending for that day.

## Personalised tickets and ticketing system

we strive to captivate users with our unexpected ticketing options.

For example, instead of displaying a standard ticket format, we incorporate a random pic of the user taken during their last match, or create a unique avatar using their profile pic, alongside their favorite cricketers. Sharing these personalized tickets on social media is a breeze!

## Traffic alert system

- The app would also provide users with real-time updates on traffic conditions and any accidents or delays along their route. If the app detects that the user's estimated time of arrival at the match is at risk of being delayed due to traffic, it would send notifications and suggest alternative routes or modes of transportation to ensure that the user arrives at the match on time. We even notify/call users about the time they need to leave their current location to make it to the match on time, based on traffic.

- In addition to traffic updates and ticket booking, the app could also offer other features such as personalized recommendations on parking options and the best entrances to use based on the user's seat location in the stadium.

## Hot replay

- Our latest feature allows fans to relive the most exhilarating moments of a match by pausing, rewinding, and fast-forwarding through a highlights reel curated by our experts. This feature provides the perfect opportunity for users to rewatch specific moments they may have missed or couldn't get enough of. Fans can even save their favorite highlights to their device, ensuring they can revisit the most captivating moments whenever they please.

- But that's not all - our app takes the cricket-watching experience to a whole new level. In addition to the highlights reel, users have access to full match replays, specific innings, live scores, stats, and expert commentary. This unparalleled level of access and immersion ensures that fans can fully engage with the game and its key moments, leaving no stone unturned when it comes to following their favorite team.

## Personalized Recommendation System

- This feature would allow fans to track their attendance and engagement with cricket matches over time, including the number of matches they have attended, the teams they have seen, and the players they have watched. The app could also provide personalized recommendations based on this information, such as suggesting matches or players that the fan may be interested in.

- For example, By leveraging the data provided by cricket fans, including their favorite cricketers, supporting teams, and more, we can connect them with like-minded individuals attending at the same stadium. This personalized approach enhances the overall match-day experience, allowing fans to connect with others who share their passions and preferences.
