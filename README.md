We are creating SmartBatter ; a VR batting experience, where fans can select their most treasured
occasions in the history of cricket such as Shane Warne’s Ball Of The Century, Lasith Malinga’s 4 in 4 or
Murali’s unpickable Doosra and experience it first hand as a batsman in their living room. Successful
completion will grant SmartBatter credit to the users. This SmartBatter credit can be used to purchase
tickets to the ICC events, ICC merchandise and unlock other scenarios in the app.
For the prototype level these scenarios will be handpicked and made available.
