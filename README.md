## Problem Statement üöß

The goal of the prototype created by developers in this track is to enhance the experience of cricket fans attending matches in stadiums. The app should provide interactive elements such as a stadium navigation guide, allow fans to participate in on-ground events, and track their movement and behavior within the stadium. The app should also provide an easy and friendly way for fans to share their experiences on social media, so that others can watch it live or on TV.
