## Project Description , Prototype and Status of Project :- 

## Problem 

# Tracking of the End-to-End Supply chain in the B2B Sports Market is very Hectic and Transparency is not there. 

# Solution 

Creating a platform that offers cricket fans a seamless and secure shopping experience is the idea behind the proposed e-commerce blockchain website for cricket merchandise. To ensure efficiency, security, and transparency in its transactions, the platform will make use of the advantages of blockchain technology. Customers will feel secure making genuine cricket merchandise purchases knowing that their financial and personal information is secure. The platform will also offer real-time shipment tracking and get rid of the possibility of fraud. The e-commerce website seeks to revolutionize the existing cricket-related e-commerce market by utilizing blockchain technology.



## Technology

This demo uses:

- Blockchain:- Polygon Test-net Mumbai / BNB Smart Chain (Smart Contract Deployment)
- Solidity:- Writing Smart Contracts 
- Truffle/Hardhat (mocha and chai library ):-  for smart contract Deployment, Testing, and Debugging Solidity smart contracts.
- Node-Js:- for Server, Rest APIs for request and post.
- Web3Js for connecting users- UI to Blockchain-backend.
- Alchemy or Infura:- to make your computer a node on Blockchain.
- Metamask:- For accomplished transactions on the blockchain.
- IPFS(interplanetary file system ) for storing transactions/Meta-Data(eg. Images and Json File) in a Decentralised way.
- Reactjs & Nextjs as frontend frameworks for the user interface.
- Oracle:- Used To Fetch Data from off-chain to on-chain
- Mongo-DB:- We can’t store all to blockchain so we need a database for essential information other than transactions.
- Hyper-ledger implementation for higher Phase of the Supply chain (implement level order blockchain).
