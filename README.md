###### Brief Description - 
The idea is to develop a stadium garbage collector model. The system will then alert the cleaning team via a mobile app or web interface, providing them with the location of the spillage provide by the user and the urgency of the situation. This will allow the cleaning team to quickly and efficiently collect the garbage before it accumulates and becomes a bigger problem. Using our model users can also dispose the garbage on their on themself and earn rewards. User will also get time based notifications for cheering, slogans and body movement reminder (in long matches eg. test matches). Another feature is by posting on the social media using hashtags provided in our app user can get featured at the stadium screen.
