###### Brief Description and Snapshots -

The current ticketing system for cricket events is facing several issues such as scalability, security, transparency, and convenience for fans. Long waiting times, ticket scalping, and unreliable sources have resulted in fans not being able to access live matches, causing disappointment and frustration.  
The idea behind the decentralized platform is to revolutionize the ticketing process for cricket events.
The Platform aims to eliminate the common issues faced by fans such as long waiting times, scalping and unreliable sources, by the power of blockchain technology.
The platform will work on a smart contract, which is act as an agreement by the ICC about the platform.
With use of smart contract, thereâ€™s no chance of selling same ticket, scalping, unreliable sources.
As tickets will be digital assets on the blockchain which will be transparent and tamperproof.
The Platform is also aiming to provide a range of features.
