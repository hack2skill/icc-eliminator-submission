#### Brief Description -

Our concept is to create a gamified metaverse version of the stadium which fans across the world can join and play around immersively. Fans can roam around the stadium, play games, chat with their friends and engage with other fans. The whole metaverse is gamified in the sense that fans get to collect coins and rewards for each and every interaction they make in the metaverse. The platform would be linked to a crypto wallet, which is directly convertible in a liquidity pool and through appropriate payment gateway api's , it can be converted into local currency across the world.
